# Deferred Hardening Tasks (Post v1 Functional Freeze)

The following items are intentionally deferred until core UI and workflows
are fully functional and stable.

- CI template linting
- Forbidden pattern scanners
- PR review enforcement
- Pre-commit hooks
- SLA rendering validation tests

Trigger for implementation:
- All core UI pages functional
- No blocking UX gaps
- Workflow actions stable
