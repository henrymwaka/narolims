**Release type:** Policy & Enforcement Milestone  
**Stability level:** Production-grade (guardrails enforced)

## Executive Summary

Version **v0.6.0-guardrails** marks a major stability and governance milestone for NARO-LIMS.

This release introduces **hard guardrails** that formally enforce business rules, workflow integrity, and access control across the system. From this version onward, invalid operations are explicitly rejected rather than silently ignored.

This release is designed to support:
- Institutional accountability
- Audit readiness
- Multi-laboratory governance
- Long-term operational stability

## What This Release Delivers

### 1. Enforced Workflow State Machines

Sample and Experiment lifecycles are now governed by explicit, centralized state machines.

- Only defined transitions are allowed
- Terminal states are locked
- Invalid transitions return structured validation errors
- All transitions are recorded in a workflow timeline

This eliminates ambiguous or inconsistent state changes.

---

### 2. Role-Aware Transition Control

Workflow transitions now require appropriate roles within the active laboratory context.

- Laboratory-scoped role checks
- Administrative overrides for authorized roles
- Explicit permission denial for unauthorized actions

This aligns system behavior with real laboratory governance structures.

---

### 3. Write Guardrails for Critical Fields

Server-controlled fields are now protected against mutation after creation.

**Examples include:**
- Project laboratory
- Project creator
- Sample project
- Sample laboratory
- Staff institute
- Staff laboratory

Attempts to modify these fields result in explicit errors:
- `400 Bad Request` for validation violations
- `403 Forbidden` for permission violations

---

### 4. Audit and Traceability Improvements

- Workflow transitions are persisted with:
  - Actor
  - Timestamp
  - From-state and to-state
- SLA hooks introduced for future compliance monitoring
- Silent data mutation paths removed

This ensures traceability for operational, regulatory, and forensic needs.

### 5. Guardrails as a Contract

This release formalizes guardrails as a **documented system contract**.

- `GUARDRAILS.md` defines what is enforced and why
- Tests encode th
